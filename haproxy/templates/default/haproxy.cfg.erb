# This is a fake-config, do not use.
# Our "real" config is haproxy.easybib.cfg.erb
# Opworks will generate haproxy.cfg from haproxy.cfg.erb and restart haproxy
# before our cookbooks are being run. Since our config references custom error
# documents, which are being rendered in haproxy::down, the "real" config would
# point towards nonexisting error documents, and haproxy would not start with
# our config, the setup would fail
#
# so we just use this dumb config which listens on 127.0.0.1 to be used with
# opsworks, and after we generate the actual config, we just restart haproxy.
#
# Using opsworks default haproxy.cfg.erb would fail as well since some of the
# backend detection magic fails with TemplateError "nil can't be coerced into Fixnum"
